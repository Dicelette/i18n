The following form will help you create a configuration file template for your server. The verification procedures are the same as for the bot, so if you have any errors, you can correct them here rather than manually.
Then simply click on "Download template" to obtain a ready-to-use configuration file.

:::note
The form also provides a `csv` file to import multiple characters at once. You can ignore this file if you don't have any data to import. For more information, you can refer to the [documentation](../sheet/import_export.md).
