The following form will help you create a configuration file template for your server. The verification procedures are the same as for the bot, so if you have any errors, you can correct them here rather than manually.
Then simply click on "Download template" to obtain a ready-to-use configuration file.

:::note
The “**Download CSV**” button generates a file that can be used to import several characters at the same time.
For more information, please refer to the [documentation](../sheet/import_export.md).
