Once the user is validated, their character sheet will be automatically published in a thread or in the chosen channel. All character sheets will follow this format:

![user embed](/assets/edit/user_embed.png)

Only the template and the user will always be present, unless no die type and no critical success/failure have been recorded in the template.

If all information is saved, you will have access to three buttons:
- Edit user data : avatar (embed thumbnail), character name or move to another user,
- Edit Statistics
- Edit Macro (which allows saving multiple new dice, but shh...)
- Add a New Die.
