Each stat has a name, a minimum value (`min`), a maximum value (`max`), and a combination option (`combination`).
- `min` and `max` define the minimum and maximum values the stat can have when recorded.
- `combination` allows combining multiple stats. This field cannot coexist with `min` and `max`, and combined stats will not count toward the total points allocated in the `total` field.

You can exclude stats from dice rolls, preventing them from being rolled. This is useful for stats not used in the game or those only utilized in formulas.
