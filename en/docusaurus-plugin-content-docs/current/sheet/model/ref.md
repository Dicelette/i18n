## Template Registration

:::usage
**`/template register [#channel] [file] (#public_channel) (#private_channel) (?update_characters) (?delete_characters)`**
- `#channel`: Channel where the template will be sent (used for sheet creation).
- `[file]`: Previously created JSON file.
- `#public_channel`: Channel where the character sheets will be published.
- `#private_character`: Channel for private sheets (see box below).
- `?update_characters`: Updates all existing character sheets if they exist.
- `?delete_characters`: Deletes all existing character sheets if they exist.

:::danger About Private Sheets
If the sheet is not marked as private but is published in a channel that users donâ€™t normally have access to, they will still be able to view the sheet using the <mark>`/show`</mark> and <mark>`/graph`</mark> commands.

The embed will be pinned for easier access.

:::danger
You must re-register the template if you want to change the default channel for public or private sheets.  
However, the registered user does **not** need to be re-registered, since the channel and message ID are saved in the database.

To move all sheets to another channel, use the [<mark>`/export`</mark>](../import_export.md) command.
:::

## Editing

To modify the template, you can use the <mark>`/template update`</mark> command.

This command allows you to upload a new JSON file that will replace the existing template. Unlike the previous command, it retains the different channels.

:::usage
**`/template update [file] (?update_characters) (?delete_characters)`**
- `[file]`: JSON file
- `?update_characters`: Updates all old character sheets.
- `?delete_characters`: Deletes all existing character sheets.
