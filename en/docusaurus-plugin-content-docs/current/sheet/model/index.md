To begin with, you need to **generate** a new template. You can create one by using the form available [right here](../form.mdx).

See the template examples in the `template` files [here](https://github.com/Dicelette/discord-dicelette/tree/main/template).

:::info Note
Statistics and dice are optional:
- <mark>`/dbroll`</mark> will only be available if you **don't** specify a die type with `$`. Otherwise, you will need to register statistics to be able to use it.
- Without dice, you won't be able to use <mark>`/macro`</mark>. 
:::

## Next steps

Once the template is ready, register it with this [command](./ref.md#template-registration).

## TLDR
1. Create the template using [form](../form.mdx).
2. Save the template with [<mark>`/template register`</mark>](./ref.md#template-registration).
3. Create a player file by clicking on the "Register character" button.
4. Fill in the character information and click on "Validate".
5. Modify command access rights if necessary.
