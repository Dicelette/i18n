## Dice Rolling

:::usage
**`/roll (argument)`**
:::

You can also use the "semi-direct" notation by adding a comment: `/roll (dice comments)`.

Please note that the "indirect" notation is not available in this mode.

## Creating a New Scene

:::usage
**`/scene [name] (tempo)`**
:::

The bot will then create a new thread, prefixed with `ðŸŽ²`, where it will send dice logs. This thread will be named after the `scene`, and all other threads prefixed with `ðŸŽ²` will be archived.

The `tempo` argument allows you to create a "temporal bubble," which will create a thread prefixed with a clock icon, and by default, the channel name will be today's date.
