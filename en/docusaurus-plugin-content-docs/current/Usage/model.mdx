## Dice Rolling

### DBRoll (`/dbroll`)

:::info
The `dbroll` command is used to roll dice for statistics that have been previously recorded, allowing you to avoid remembering the basic characteristics of a character.
:::

:::usage
**`/dbroll [statistic] (*character) (comment) (replacer) (modifiers)`**
:::

The command requires specifying:
- The statistic
- The character's name
- Any modifiers (such as advantage or disadvantage)
- Replacement of the success value (e.g., for a difficult roll), with indication of comparison (e.g., >= 10)
- Any comments on your action

## Others

The following three commands accept :
- `(@player)` : The player's name
- `(*character)` : And/or the character's name

### Display

:::usage
**`/display (@player) (*character)`**
:::

The `display` command allows you to view the statistics and dice of a character recorded in the database.

### Graph (`/graph`)

:::usage
**`/graph (@player) (*character) (line) (bg) (min) (max)`**
:::

The `/graph` command is a "gimmick" feature that generates a graph from a character's statistics. 
Optionally, you can also specify colors with:
- `line`: For lines (default, `#0e47b2`).
- `background`: For background (default, `#0e47b2`).

Colors can be in hexadecimal or RGB. For example, `#FF0000` or `255,0,0`.

Finally, you can set a minimum and maximum for the axes with `min` and `max`.

By default:
- The minimum is calculated according to the server template (if existing).
- The maximum is determined in different ways:
   - If a maximum is defined by the template, it will be used.
   - Otherwise, it will be based on the critical success value.
   - If neither of the two previous options is available, it will be based on the die value (for example, if `1d20`, the value will be 20).
   - As a last resort, it will be automatically calculated based on the user's statistics.

### Edit user (`/edit`)
If the embed doesn't have the `select` button, it will be automatically added by the command.

#### Avatar (`/edit avatar`)
:::usage
**`/edit avatar [url] (@player) (*character)`**
:::

The `edit_avatar` command lets you modify the image of a character stored in the database.
This will change the embedding of the character sheet.

By default, the command will modify the image of the person who used it. Only moderators can modify the image of another player.

:::warning
Images stored on Discord cannot be used as their links change regularly. It is therefore mandatory to use external links, for example, by using [imgur](https://imgur.com/).

#### Rename (`/edit rename`)

:::usage
**`/edit rename [new_name] (@player) (*character)`**
:::

Allow to rename a character.

:::warning
This command doesn't allow duplicate name. You need to use different name for each character.
:::

#### User (`/edit user`)

:::usage
**`/edit user [@new_user] (@player) (*character)`**
:::

Move a character from a player to a new user. 

:::warning
It's not a copy! It will delete the character from the previous user!
:::

The action will be undone in case of duplicate name.
