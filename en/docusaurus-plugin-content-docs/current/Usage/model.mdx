## Dice Rolling

The two commands require specifying:
- <CL>Character</CL>: The character's name
- <CL>Comment</CL>: Any comments on your action
- <CL>expression</CL>: Any expressions defining conditions or modifications (such as advantage or disadvantage), which can include dice rolls, mathematical formulas, statistics names, or even the exact value of the statistic using the `$` keyword.

### DBRoll (`/dbroll`)

:::info
The `dbroll` command is used to roll dice for statistics that have been previously recorded, allowing you to avoid remembering the basic characteristics of a character.
:::

:::usage
**`/dbroll [statistic] (*character) (comment) (success_threshold) (expression)`**
:::

The commands require you to choose the statistic to use.
It is also possible to specify a <CL>success threshold</CL> to determine or overrides the success threshold. This threshold is composed by a sign (like `>=`) and a value. It is possible to combine dice rolls, statistic names, and mathematical formulas in the expression.

### DBD (`/dbd`)

:::info
The `dbd` command allows rolling a registered die.
:::

:::usage
**`/dbd [*dice] (*character) (expression) (comment)`**
:::

Here, the command requires you to choose the die to use. It is not possible to choose a success threshold, although it is possible to specify it in the die itself when registering it.

## Calculations (`/calc`)

:::info
The `calc` allow to realize calculations with the statistics of the character and apply an [expression](../introduction/expression.mdx)
:::

:::usage
**`/calc [statistic] [*sign] [expression] (*transform) (*character) (comment)`**
:::

The command requires:
- **<CL>statistic</CL>**: The statistic to use.  
- **<CL>sign</CL>**: The sign of the operation to perform. Valid signs are: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^` (power), `%` (modulo), `/` (division), `≠` (not equal to), `=` (equal to), `⩾` (greater than or equal to), `⩽` (less than or equal to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than).  
- **<CL>expression</CL>**: The expression to apply.  
- **<CL>transform</CL>**: The transformation to apply to the final result, including: `ceil` (round up), `floor` (round down), `round` (round to the nearest integer), `abs` (absolute value), `sqrt` (square root), or `square` (square the value). You can combine two transformations, such as `ceil(abs())`. Additionally, it is possible to use [functions supported by `mathjs`](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html), even if they are not in the list of suggested terms. The allowed function needs to take only one argument (or optionnaly two, but the second won't be set).

:::note
It is possible to use the "non ascii" version of the signs, for example `>=` for `⩾` or `!=` for `≠` and `==` for `=`.

## Others

The following three commands accept :
- `(@player)` : The player's name
- `(*character)` : And/or the character's name

### Display

:::usage
**`/display (@player) (*character)`**
:::

The `display` command allows you to view the statistics and dice of a character recorded in the database.

### Graph (`/graph`)

:::usage
**`/graph (@player) (*character) (line) (bg) (min) (max)`**
:::

The `/graph` command is a "gimmick" feature that generates a graph from a character's statistics. 
Optionally, you can also specify colors with:
- `line`: For lines (default, `#0e47b2`).
- `background`: For background (default, `#0e47b2`).

Colors can be in hexadecimal or RGB. For example, `#FF0000` or `255,0,0`.

Finally, you can set a minimum and maximum for the axes with `min` and `max`.

By default:
- The minimum is calculated according to the server template (if existing).
- The maximum is determined in different ways:
   - If a maximum is defined by the template, it will be used.
   - Otherwise, it will be based on the critical success value.
   - If neither of the two previous options is available, it will be based on the die value (for example, if `1d20`, the value will be 20).
   - As a last resort, it will be automatically calculated based on the user's statistics.
