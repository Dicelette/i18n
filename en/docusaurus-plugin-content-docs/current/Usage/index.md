In several commands, it is possible to combine both a username and a character. 

By default, the characters displayed in the list are those of the user who typed the command. 

If you wish to display another player's characters, you must mention the player first. 

:::warning
Due to certain limitations of the Discord API, if you wish to change player, you must retype the entire command.

This function is extended to the `/gm dbd` command, as the dice listed will be based on the character, listed from the player. In fact, by default, skills are listed from the player who made the command.
