Welcome! ðŸŽ² Here's your companion for adventures on Discord: a versatile bot designed to make your role-playing game sessions smoother and more enjoyable.

## Main Features

### Dice Rolling

With this bot, rolling dice is a breeze! Whether you're determining the outcome of a crucial action or adding some spice to your conversations, the process is simple. Just use the appropriate command, and the result will be displayed in a thread, keeping your channel clutter-free.

### Character Sheet Management

No more juggling complex character sheets! This bot allows you to set up a stat template to store essential information about your characters. You can roll dice directly using this data without worrying about remembering it all.

## How It Works

### Dice Rolling

For dice rolls, the bot uses the [@diceRoller](https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/) API.

### Stat Management

Instead of saving the entire character sheet, the bot only records the message and its ID. This way, you retain full control over your data, as the message content is not stored outside the server.

## Data Management

This bot uses a database[^1] to store essential information such as message IDs, channel IDs, stat names, and character names of users. The database is cleaned in various scenarios, such as when registered messages or channels are deleted, the bot is removed from the server, or when `/register` or `/logs` commands are used.

:::note Reminder
User data is not deleted when they leave a server. If you want your data to be removed, feel free to contact me.

Provide your Discord ID or server ID (with proof of ownership) via Discord (`@mara__li`) or email (`lisandra_dev@yahoo.com`).
:::

:::warning
In rare cases, data may not be deleted (particularly for very old records). In such cases, you can use the `/delete_char` command to remove a character or all data for a player.  
This command will also delete the character sheet message if it still exists.
