## How It Works

### Technical Architecture

The bot uses the [@diceRoller](https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/) API for all dice calculations, ensuring reliable results and a wide variety of supported expressions.

### Data-Respectful Approach

Unlike other solutions, this bot prioritizes your control over your data:
- **Minimal storage**: Only message IDs and essential information are saved
- **Full control**: Your character sheets remain in your Discord messages
- **Automatic cleanup**: Obsolete data is automatically deleted

This approach guarantees maximum security and full control over your gaming information.

## Data Management

### What is Stored

The bot uses a SQLite3 database[^1] to store only:
- IDs of messages containing your sheets
- Links between users and their characters
- Server configuration settings
- Custom statistics templates

### Automatic Cleanup

Data is automatically deleted in several cases:
- Deletion of registered messages or channels
- Bot removal from the server
- Use of integrated cleanup features

### Privacy Respect

:::note Contact for deletion
If you want to delete your data after leaving a server, contact us via Discord (`@mara__li`) or email (`lisandra_dev@yahoo.com`) with your Discord ID or server ID.
:::

:::warning Manual cleanup
In case of issues with automatic deletion, use the manual deletion commands available in the bot to clean up your data.
