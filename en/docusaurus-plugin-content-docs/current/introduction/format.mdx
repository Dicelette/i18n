## Symbols and Expressions

- **<mark>`$`</mark>** :
	  - <CL>Usage</CL>: Represents the value of the statistic used in the dice formula.
	  - <CL>Where?</CL> Used in dice types (`/dbroll`, `/calc`, critical formulas, etc.)  
    :::example
      - `1d6 > $`: Compares the dice result to the selected statistic value.
      - `1d6 + $`: Adds the statistic to the dice result.
      - `1d100 <=$`: For systems like Call of Cthulhu, compares to the stat threshold.
    :::

- **<mark>`{exp}`</mark>** :
	  - <CL>Usage:</CL> Allows inserting a dynamic expression into a dice formula, derived from a calculated part of the command.
	  - <CL>Advanced Syntax:</CL> `{exp||default}` allows defining a default value if the expression is not provided.  
        :::example `{exp||2}` (default value = 2)
        :::
	  - <CL>Where?</CL> Often used in templates or reusable formulas to inject a dynamic value at roll time.  
    :::example
      - `1d6 > {exp}`: the value of `exp` will be replaced at roll time.
      - `1d6 > {exp||10}`: if `exp` is not provided, the comparison is made to 10.
    :::

- **<mark>`{{...}}`</mark>** :
	  - <CL>Usage:</CL> Delimits a complex mathematical expression evaluated by <mark>MathJS</mark>.
	  - <CL>Where?</CL> In all commands supporting formulas (`/calc`, `/dbroll`, `/macro`, etc.)
    :::example
      - `1d6 + {{ceil($ / 2)}}`: Adds the rounded half of the stat to the dice result.
      - `1d6 > {{ceil($ / 2)}}`: The success threshold is half the stat, rounded.
    :::

- **<mark>`[comment]`</mark>** :
	  - <CL>Usage:</CL> Adds a comment to a dice roll.  
	  - <CL>Where?</CL> In [shared dice](./expression.mdx#shared-unique-rolls-reusing-results).  
    :::example `1d20;&-2[HP Loss]`: Applies -2 to the result of `1d20` and annotates the  second line result.
    :::

- **<mark>`#comment`</mark>** :
	  - <CL>Usage:</CL> Global comment for a dice roll. The `#` symbol can be omitted when used in direct messages.  
	  - <CL>Where?</CL> At the end of the dice roll, to annotate the action. Also allows creating a global comment in shared dice.  
	    Not used for dice via slash commands.  
    :::example
    - `1d20+5 # My dice roll`
    - `1d20;&+5;&*2 # My shared dice roll`
    :::

- **<mark>`&`</mark>**, **<mark>`;&+x;`</mark>**, etc.** :
	  - <CL>Usage:</CL> Allows reusing the result of the same dice in multiple formulas (unique shared rolls).
    :::example
    ```
    /roll 1d20;&+5;&*2
    ```
    Displays:
    ```
    ※ 1d20 ⟶ [14] =  14
    ◈ [1d20]+5 ⟶ [14]+5 =  19
    ◈ [1d20]×2 ⟶ [14]×2 =  28
    ```
    :::

- **<mark>`()`</mark> (parentheses in dice names)** :
	- <CL>Usage:</CL> Specifies the statistic to use for custom criticals.  
    :::example[ `Animal Instinct (Strength)` ]
    :::
- **<mark>@nom</mark>** :
	- Usage: Allow to use a character in the rolls (in the command `/roll`, [the messages](../usage/message.md) et `/mj roll`)
		- Also allow to mention someone else to roll a dice on your behalf (only for moderator) in the [direct dice syntax](../usage/message.md).
	:::example[ `1d100 @character` ]
	:::

- **<mark>`$stat`</mark>** :
    - <CL>Usage:</CL> Allows to use the value of a statistic.
    - <CL>Where:</CL> In dice rolls (in `/roll`, [the messages](../usage/message.md) et `/mj roll`) as well as in expressions.
    :::example [`1d20 + $strength`]
    :::

:::example
- **Dice type:**  
	  - `1d6 > $` or `1d6 + $`  
	  - `1d6 + {{ceil($/2)}}`
- **Macro:**
	  - `1d6 > Strength` or `1d6 + Strength`  
	  - `1d6 + {{ceil(Strength / 2)}}`
- **Custom critical:**  
	  - Name: `Animal Instinct (Strength)`  
	  - Formula: `>$` (`$` will be replaced by the Strength value)  
	  - Result: `1d6>10` (if `Strength = 10`)

## Commands syntax

- Mandatory fields are enclosed in square brackets: <mark class='green'>`[fields]`</mark>.
- Optional fields are enclosed in brackets: <mark class='green'>`(fields)`</mark>.
- Auto-complete fields are marked with a <mark>`*`</mark>: <mark class='green'>`(*fields)`</mark>.
- Fields requiring a statement will be marked with <mark>`@`</mark> (<mark class='green'>`@fields`</mark>). These fields work with names (role or user, depending on the command) or <mark>Discord IDs</mark>. If the entry doesn't appear immediately, start typing the beginning of the name for auto-completion.
- In a similar way, commands requesting a salon are preceded by <mark>`#`</mark> like <mark class='green'>`#fields`</mark>.
- True/false fields (`true` or `false`) are prefixed by <mark>`?`</mark> <mark class='green'>(`?fields`)</mark>.

### Auto-complete commands

In several commands, it's possible to combine both a username and a character.

By default, the characters displayed in the list are those of the user who typed the command.

If you wish to display another player's characters, you must mention the player first.

:::warning
Due to certain limitations of the Discord API, if you wish to change player, you must retype the entire command.
:::

This function is extended to the `/mj macro` command, as the dice listed will be based on the character, listed therefore from the player. In fact, by default, skills are listed from the player who made the command.
