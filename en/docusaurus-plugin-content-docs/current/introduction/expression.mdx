The bot uses the [dice roller](https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/)[^1] library for dice rolls and supports its syntax. 
However, there are some differences as Dicelette aims to be more flexible and display dice roll results in a more readable way.

## Differences with Dice Roller
### Extended Syntax for Comments

Dicelette extends the Dice Roller syntax by taking inspiration from [Dice Parser](https://invent.kde.org/rolisteam/rolisteam-diceparser/-/blob/master/HelpMe.md#comment): 
- The use of `# comment` in addition to the basic syntax for comments.
- The ability to use `[comment]` to annotate a shared dice roll, providing context for each result line.

### Comparators

By default, when a comparison sign (`>`, `<`, `=`, etc.) is present, the bot will consider the total and the compared value (while rolling and/or calculating if necessary) and indicate whether the roll is a failure or a success: 
:::roll[ **Success** — `1d20` ⟶ `[20]` = `[20] > 10` ]
:::

However, some systems require counting the number of rolls above (or below) a value rather than comparing the total result. 
To maintain compatibility between Dicelette and Dice Roller, the roll must be enclosed in curly braces `{}`, such as `{3d12>20}`.
:::roll[ `{3d12>20} ⟶ {[11, 9, 7]} =  [0] `]
:::

In these specific cases, the bot will not display success, failure, or critical text, and does the same when using [target failure](https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/guide/notation/group-rolls.html#target-failure-dice-pool).

:::note
- `{1d3}>20` will yield the same result as `1d3>20`
- But **not** `{1d3,1d6}>20`, which retains the default Dice Roller syntax. To compare the total to a value, use `1d3+1d6>20`.
:::

:::tldr
- If you want to count the number of dice passing a comparison, you must enclose the die and comparator in curly braces `{}`.
- If you want to use target failures, you must retain the Dice Roller syntax.
:::

#### Opposition Comparison

A die roll can be compared to an opposition using the following syntax: `dice[base comparison][opposition]`.
⚠️ An opposition cannot be used alone: it acts as a secondary validation, and therefore requires a base comparison to function.

:::roll[1d20>10>5]
**Success** — `1d20` ⟶ `[20]` = `[20] > 5` (__opposition__)  & `> 10` (__base__)
:::

### Critical Successes and Failures

You can define thresholds for critical successes and failures in dice rolls using the following syntax:
- <CL>Critical Failure</CL>: `{cf:[sign](value)}`
- <CL>Critical Success</CL>: `{cs:[sign](value)}`

This expression can be placed anywhere in the dice roll, except after a comment, and must be **attached** directly to the die (no space between the die and the expression).

Where:
- `sign` is the comparison operator (`>`, `<`, `=`, etc.).
- `value` can be a number, a die, a math expression, or a statistic (just like [custom criticals](../sheet/model/critics.md#custom-critics)).
- `*` (optional) allows comparison only on the **natural die** (the first dice roll), not the total.

:::roll[ **Critical Failure** — `1d20>=20{cf:>10}` ⟶ `[20]` = ` 20 > 10 ` ]
:::
:::roll[ **Critical Success** — `{cs:<2}1d20<=1` ⟶ `[1]` = ` 1 < 2 ` ]
:::

:::tip
The full formula syntax is: `{c[f|s]:[>=<!]+(text)}`
:::

:::warning[ This method is not compatible with the exceptions mentioned in the previous section. ]
:::

## Mathematical Expressions with MathJS

The bot uses the [mathjs](https://mathjs.org/) library to evaluate mathematical expressions. You can use complex mathematical expressions when they are enclosed in `{{` and `}}`.

Depending on the commands, you can use:
- `$`: Represents the value of the used statistic.
- The name of a statistic (which will be replaced by its value).
- Dice combinations (like `1d6`).
- `{exp}`: This syntax allows you to directly insert an expression into the die, reusing the calculated part of the command. A default value can be specified using the syntax `{exp||default}` (e.g., `{exp||2}`). Otherwise, the default value will be `1`.

Expressions are generally used in:
- <CL>success_threshold</CL>: Success threshold for dice rolls in the [`/dbroll`](../usage/model/dice.mdx#dbroll-dbroll) command.
- <CL>expression</CL>: For the [`/calc`](../usage/model/calc.mdx#based-on-statistic-calc), [`/dbroll`](../usage/model/dice.mdx#dbroll-dbroll), and [`/macro`](../usage/model/dice.mdx#macro-macro) commands.
- <CL>opposition</CL>: For the [`/dbroll`](../usage/model/dice.mdx#dbroll-dbroll) and [`/macro`](../usage/model/dice.mdx#macro-macro) commands.

### Examples of Mathematical Expressions

- `1d6 + {{ceil($ / 2)}}`
- `1d6 > {{ceil($ / 2)}}`

## Shared Unique Rolls (Reusing Results)

You can use the syntax `die;&+x;µ*y` to roll a single die and apply different formulas to the same die, displaying the result of each formula. The `&` represents the die result.

:::warning
You must not have spaces before or after the separator between formulas, otherwise the bot will treat the rest as comments.
:::

:::example
/roll 1d20;&+5;&*2
Will display the result as:
```
  ※ `1d20` ⟶ `[10]` = ` 10 `  
  ◈ `[1d20]+5` ⟶ `[10]+5` = ` 15 `  
  ◈ `[1d20]×2` ⟶ `[10]×2` = ` 20 `  
```
:::

:::

::::tip
You can use dice in the formulas, but only the first die will be saved and reused.
:::roll[ `1d20;&+1d4;&*2`]
```
  ※ `1d20` ⟶ `[7]` = ` 7 `  
  ◈ `[1d20]+1d4` ⟶ `7+[1]` = ` 8 `  
  ◈ `[1d20]×2` ⟶ `[7]×2` = ` 14 `  
```
:::
::::

To comment between each roll, use the `[comment]` syntax. A global comment should use the `#comment` syntax at the end of the dice.[^2]

:::roll[ `1d20;&-2 [hp loss] #comments` ]
*comments*
  ※ `1d20` ⟶ `[2]` = ` 2 `  
  ◈ <u>hp loss</u> — `[1d20]-2` ⟶ `[2]-2` = ` 0 `  
:::

Finally, it is possible to hide the first die using the syntax `(die)`:
:::roll[ `(1d20);&>100;&+2` ]  
  **Failure** — `[1d20]>100` ⟶ `[12]>100` = ` 12<100 `  
  ◈ `[1d20]+2` ⟶ `[12]+2` = ` 14 `

:::danger[It is not possible to use bulk dice in this syntax.]
:::

## Bulk Rolls

The bot also supports the `x#(dice)` notation, inspired by [rollem](https://rollem.rocks/docs/v1-syntax/bulk-rolling) for "bulk rolls".

:::roll[ `4#2d10` ]  
  `2d10` ⟶ `[2, 7]` = ` [9] `  
  `2d10` ⟶ `[2, 8]` = ` [10] `  
  `2d10` ⟶ `[4, 3]` = ` [7] `  
  `2d10` ⟶ `[8, 9]` = ` [17] `  
:::

[^1]: Dice Roller itself uses [random-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-js) for random generation, not `math.random` which is pseudo-random. So it's not possible to cheat on dice results (unless you're a cryptomancer or can see the future... Or both.).
[^2]: Shared dice and comments are very sensitive to spaces. Thus, bracketed dice comments must be preceded by a space, as must global comments. The `#` in global comments must be pasted into the comment text, without spaces.
