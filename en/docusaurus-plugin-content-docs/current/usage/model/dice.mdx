import { CL} from "@site/src/components/utils.tsx";

The two commands require specifying:
- <CL>Character</CL>: The character's name
- <CL>Comment</CL>: Any comments on your action
- <CL>expression</CL>: Any expressions defining conditions or modifications (such as advantage or disadvantage), which can include dice rolls, mathematical formulas, statistics names, or even the exact value of the statistic using the `$` keyword.

## DBRoll (`/dbroll`)

:::info
The `dbroll` command is mainly used to roll dice on the statistics recorded for a character, thus avoiding the need to retain a character's basic characteristics.  
However, if the die type used **does not contain `$`**, it is possible to use the command without a sheet: the roll will then be made as a "global die", without associated statistics.
:::

:::usage
**`/dbroll (*statistic) (*character) (comment) (success_threshold) (expression)`**
- <CL>statistic</CL>: The statistic to use, only needed if the die type contains `$`.
- <CL>*character</CL>: The character to use, if any.
- <CL>comment</CL>: Any comments on your action.
- <CL>success_threshold</CL>: The success threshold to use, if any.
- <CL>expression</CL>: Any expressions defining conditions or modifications.
- <CL>opposition</CL>: The "secondary" success threshold.
:::

The commands allow to choose the statistic to use if the die type contains `$`.

It is also possible to specify a <CL>success threshold</CL> to determine or overrides the success threshold. This threshold is composed by a sign (like `>=`) and a value. It is possible to combine dice rolls, statistic names, and mathematical formulas in the expression.
The <CL>opposition</CL> threshold works similarly, but it is only validated if the main success threshold is reached. It can also contain mathematical expressions, statistics, or dice rolls.

:::tip
It is possible not to specify the comparison sign, in which case the success threshold will use the default one, if available.
If the sign is completely absent, this option will be ignored for syntax error.

## macro (`/macro`)

:::info
The `macro` command is used to roll a die stored in a character's file and/or the server template.
If a die is registered in the template, it will be considered as a global die and can be used without a character if it does not contain `$` or the name of a statistic.
:::

:::usage
**`/macro [*dice] (*character) (expression) (comment)`**
- <CL>*dice</CL>: The macro to use (saved die)
- <CL>*character</CL>: The character to use, if any.
- <CL>expression</CL>: Any expressions defining conditions or modifications.
- <CL>comment</CL>: Any comments on your action.
- <CL>opposition</CL>: The "secondary" success threshold, only evaluated if there is a main success threshold, registered in the die.
:::

Here, the command requires you to choose the die to use. It is not possible to choose a success threshold, although it is possible to specify it in the die itself when registering it. In this case, the <CL>opposition</CL> threshold can be used as a secondary success threshold, only evaluated if the main success threshold is reached.
