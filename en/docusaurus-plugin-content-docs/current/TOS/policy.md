### Dicelette Privacy Policy

Welcome to Dicelette (https://dicelette.github.io/). Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, disclose and protect your information when you use our Dicelette Discord bot.

#### 1. Information Collection

**Personal Information:**
Dicelette does not collect any personally identifiable information except as necessary for its operation.

**Non-Personal Information:**
We record the user IDs, messages and rooms used (only in the form of discord IDs) by the dice model, the names of the model's stats and skills, and the names of the characters and their skills.

[**Intents**](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#privileged-intents): To function, the bot requires the following intents: 
- `Server Members`: To access server members and assign roles to them.
- Messages`: To read and send messages, including dice by direct command.

#### 2. Use of collected information

The information collected is used to provide and improve the functionality of Dicelette. Data is automatically deleted when the bot is removed from the server.
