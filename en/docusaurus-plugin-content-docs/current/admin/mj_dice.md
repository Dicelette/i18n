:::info
The two following commands allow game masters to roll dice for any registered players.
:::

:::usage
- **`/gm dbroll (@player) [statistic] (*character)`**
- **`/gm dbd (@player) (*dice name) (*character)`**
:::

Both commands are similar to [dbroll](./model#dbroll-dbroll) and [dbd](./model#dbd-dbd), but additionally require specification of the player for whom the roll is being made. As with the other commands, you can choose a character belonging to this player or leave the default choice.
