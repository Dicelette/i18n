:::usage
- **`/config auto_role dice (@role)**
- **`/config auto_role stats (@role)**
:::

Theses commands allow to automatically add role when:
- A dice is added (with `/config auto_role dice`)
- Stats are validated (with `/config auto_role stats`)

This allows to restrict the usage of `/dbd` and `/dbroll` to the user that have the possibility to use it.

If role is not specified, the auto-role will be disable.
